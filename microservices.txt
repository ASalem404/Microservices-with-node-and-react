Kubernates:
	Kubernates cluster: is a collection of nodes and master to manage them
	node : is a machine will run our containers
	pod  : more or less than a running container
	deployment : monitors a set of pods and sure that they all running and if one fails
		     restart it.
	service : provides an easy to remember URL for access containers
	
	we manage kubernates using config file, its a YAML file use to write confige for objects
	also u can directly config kubernates without using config file but its a bad peractice
	don't do that.
	
	Network with services: 
	 	1) Cluster IP ==> setup communication between pods in the cluster
	 	2) NodePort   ==> make a pod accessible from outside  the cluster, used only in dev perpose.
	 	3) Load Balancer ==> make a pod accessible from outside  the cluster.


==> why we dont use cookie to handle expiration of session ?
	- cookie is handled by the browser, so the browser after couple of time,
		will expire the cookie, but its easy for any user to copy the cookie and ignore 
		the expiration date, and continue using the cookie to get the response.
		so we use JWT because expiration date is encrypted inside it in someway.
		
==> How to create secret for jwt in K8S ?? 
	- kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=jwt=asdf
	
==> we can override the machanism of converting object to json by adding a func called toJSON to the object
	ex:	person = {name:"Ahmed", toJson(){return 1}}
	anytime you called JSON.stringfy(person) ==> it will return 1
	
==> if you want to check if session is defined in header and if jwt is defined in header in session field 
	you can do that in this statement  if(!req.session || !req.session.jwt)  XX
	but you can do it like this if(!req.session?.jwt)
