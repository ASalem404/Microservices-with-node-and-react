Kubernates:
	Kubernates cluster: is a clooection of nodes and master to manage them
	node : is a machine will run our containers
	pod  : more or less than a running container
	deployment : monitors a set of pods and sure that they all running and if one fails
		     restart it.
	service : provides an easy to remember URL for access containers
	
	we manage kubernates using config file, its a YAML file use to write confige for objects
	also u can directly config kubernates without using config file but its a bad peractice
	don't do that.
	
	Network with services: 
	 	1) Cluster IP ==> setup communication between pods in the cluster
	 	2) NodePort   ==> make a pod accessible from outside  the cluster, used only in dev perpose.
	 	3) Load Balancer ==> make a pod accessible from outside  the cluster.
