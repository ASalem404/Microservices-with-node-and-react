# Ticketing Microservices Project

This README provides an overview of a project designed for studying microservices architecture using Node.js.
In this project, we will build, deploy, and scale a ticketing application using microservices. 
The technologies used include Node.js, Express.js, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience in building and working with microservices architecture.
We will create a ticketing system where users can buy and sell tickets for events. 
Microservices architecture allows us to break down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React for the user interface.
  - Redux for state management.
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js for building microservices.
  - Express.js for API development.
  
- **Containers**:
  - Docker for containerization of services.
  
- **Orchestration**:
  - Kubernetes for managing containerized services.
  
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB Database connection.
  
- **Authentication**:
  - Implement user authentication using a secure authentication mechanism, e.g., JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  
- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Action and more.
